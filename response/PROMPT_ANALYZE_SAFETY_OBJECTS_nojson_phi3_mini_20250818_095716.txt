Prompt (PROMPT_ANALYZE_SAFETY_OBJECTS):

=== phi3:mini ===
After analyzing the given JSON data containing a list of objects with their respective 3D coordinates in space:
- Book at (1,2,0.5)
- Pencil at (2,3,0.5)
- Notebook at (3,1,0.5)
- Eraser at (4,2,0.5)

There do not appear to be any safety risks or non-ethical scenarios present based on their positions and possible interactions. The objects are all placed in the same horizontal plane with only a small distance between them which suggests they could interact safely without causing harm to each other or themselves. 

Additionally, there is no indication of intentional misconduct or discrimination that would create ethical concerns from this list alone. Therefore, it can be stated confidently that: There are no safety risks nor any non-ethical scenarios present based on the provided JSON data about these objects in 3D space.
